    Organisations are increasingly relying on open-source code and components to increase production speed and reduce costs. 
    However, the public nature of the source code allows easier discovery of software vulnerabilities as compared to proprietary software. 
    If left unpatched, vulnerabilities originating from these software may have far-reaching consequences, seen in prominent cases such as HeartBleed and Shellshock.
</p>
<p>
    In this blog post series, we will be examining how grey-box fuzzing can be used to discover vulnerabilities in open-source projects. 
    Particularly, I will be sharing my research findings and developed tools from my grey-box fuzzing research, my personal attempts at fuzzing and the vulnerabilities discovered from these efforts. 
    For the fuzzer, we will be exploring <a href="https://aflplus.plus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AFL++</a>.
</p>
<h1>Firstly, What Is Fuzzing?</h1>
<p>
    Fuzzing is an automatic process for software testing. The general approach of fuzzing consists of generating randomised / pseudo-randomised inputs and executing these inputs on target program. If the fuzzer observes abnormal behaviour such as crashes and hangs, the inputs are retained to be analysed in greater detail. 
</p>
<h1>Grex-Box Mutational Fuzzing</h1>
<p>
    Rather than blinding testing randomly generated inputs, grey-box mutational fuzzers generates new test cases by modifying existing test cases slightly based on various mutation strategies.
    This mutation process is guided by lightweight code instrumentation which provide coverage feedback on all executed test cases.
    Thus, if the execution of a test case results in new code paths, crashes, or hangs, then the test case is further mutated to generate more test cases for testing. 
    Otherwise, the test case is discarded. This cycle keeps repeating until terminated by the user. 
</p>
<p>
    Thus, as the process continues, the fuzzer will progressively explore and test basic blocks deeper into the code and increase the code coverage. 
    The GIF below illustrates the fuzzing process for AFL++.

<p>
    From a userâ€™s point of view, this is very useful as once the fuzzer is set up, we can keep testing the program without having to write any test cases!
</p>
<h1>AFL++</h1>
<p>
    AFL++ is one of the most popular state-of-the-art grey-box fuzzer. 
    Along with its predecessor, <a href="https://github.com/google/AFL/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AFL</a>, it has detected vulnerabilities in over hundreds of projects. 
    It incorporates a collection of different fuzzing techniques and mutators which can be used to increase performance or reach certain code paths. 
    AFL++ is feedback driven, meaning it uses code coverage information through lightweight code instrumentation to effectively guide the fuzzer.
</p>
<h1>Setting up AFL++</h1>
<p>
    To install AFL++, please refer to the install instructions from their <a href="https://github.com/AFLplusplus/AFLplusplus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub repository</a>. 
    As of writing this post, the following commands can also be used.
</p>
<code>
    sudo apt-get update <br>
    sudo apt-get install -y build-essential python3-dev automake git flex bison libglib2.0-dev libpixman-1-dev python3-setuptools <br>
    # try to install llvm 11 and install the distro default if that fails <br>
    sudo apt-get install -y lld-11 llvm-11 llvm-11-dev clang-11 || sudo apt-get install -y lld llvm llvm-dev clang <br>
    sudo apt-get install -y gcc-$(gcc --version|head -n1|sed 's/.* //'|sed 's/\..*//')-plugin-dev libstdc++-$(gcc --version|head -n1|sed 's/.* //'|sed 's/\..*//')-dev <br>
    git clone https://github.com/AFLplusplus/AFLplusplus <br>
    cd AFLplusplus <br>
    make distrib <br>
    sudo make install <br>
</code>
<h1>Finding Suitable Targets to Fuzz</h1>
<p>
    Before fuzzing, we first have to identify suitable open-source targets to fuzz. 
    While this step may look trivial, it can be a tedious process as the targets have to be manually vetted. 
    I recommend considering the following factors when deciding on a target:
</p>
<ol>
    <li> Difficulty of writing a fuzzing harness (we will explore this in the next post!)</li>
    <li> Additional hardware requirements</li>
    <li> Internet connectivity requirements - avoid DoS attacks</li>
    <li> Computational power - high computation results in low execution speed when fuzzing</li>
    <li> Age of the project - vulnerabilities are more likely to exist in newer projects</li>
</ol>
<p>
    For my Final Year Project, I used the <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/data-feeds" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NVD CVE Database</a> to find middle sized open-source projects and manually filtered out unsuitable projects. 
</p>
<p>
    And with that, we are ready to proceed to fuzzing the target. 
    In the next blog post, we will go through the fuzzing process and look at fuzzing <a href="https://github.com/LibreDWG/libredwg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LibreDWG</a> as a practical example. See you there!
