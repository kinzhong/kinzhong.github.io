<p>Organisations are increasingly relying on open-source code and components to increase speed and costs. However, the public nature of the source code allows easier discovery of software vulnerabilities as compared to proprietary software. If left unpatched, this can be exploited by malicious actors.
In this post, we will be examining how grey-box fuzzing can be used to discover vulnerabilities in open-source projects. Particularly, I will be sharing my findings and developed tools from my grey-box fuzzing research, my personal attempts at fuzzing and the vulnerabilities discovered from these efforts. For the fuzzer, we will be exploring AFL (https://github.com/google/AFL) and AFL++ (https://aflplus.plus/).
I hope that this information and developed tools can be used to minimise the impact of undisclosed vulnerabilities.
